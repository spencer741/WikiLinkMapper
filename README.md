# WikiLinkMapper
Creating a link map from Wikipedia Links.

traversal nature is a revision of pre-order.

Trying to treat wikipedia as a tree structure, when in fact it is more of a complex semi-meshed graph ... this idealogy will change with time and as the complexity of the project increases.

Creating a knowledge map of Wikipedia by developing different traversal algorithms to scrape Wikipedia, treating each URL as a node of knowledge that could later be organized and presented for faster learning. Although this project is in its infancy, I could see major applications in open-sourced education.

### TO DO:
* Make project easily deployable with mysql requirements and db creation.
* analyze use of self-referencing key to store hierarchy integrity.
